Welcome! 

Before you can login we need to verify your account. Below is a link with which to verify the account you recently created on our website.  

@{link}

If you've received an account verification email in error. Please DO NOT click the above link for your own safety. It's likely that another user entered your email address while trying to create an account with us. If you didn't initiate this request, you don't need to take any further action. You can simply disregard the verification email, and the account won't be verified or used. We delete unverified and unused accounts after a period of time.

Kind regards"
